## About The Project

This web platform for restaurants is a comprehensive solution developed as part of my final university project. Its primary objective is to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for restaurants to manage various aspects of their operations. The platform offers a range of functionalities, including booking management, inventory control, kitchen order management, and employee administration. In addition, it seamlessly integrates with the Android app developed specifically for clients and employees.

With the web platform, restaurant owners and managers gain the ability to streamline their booking system, allowing for easy management of reservations, table assignments, and customer preferences. The inventory management feature enables efficient tracking and control of ingredients, supplies, and stock levels, aiding in optimizing restaurant operations and reducing waste. Moreover, the kitchen order management system ensures smooth communication between the front-of-house staff and the kitchen, enhancing order accuracy and overall customer satisfaction.

The platform also encompasses robust employee management capabilities, facilitating tasks such as shift scheduling, task assignment, performance tracking, and payroll management. By centralizing these essential functions, the platform simplifies administrative processes and promotes effective coordination among restaurant staff.

Furthermore, the integration with the Android app enhances the overall experience for both clients and employees. Clients can conveniently make reservations, view menus, and receive updates, all through their mobile devices. Employees, on the other hand, can access important information, such as schedules and orders directly from the app, increasing efficiency and collaboration within the restaurant.
